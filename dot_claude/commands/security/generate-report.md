description: Generate comprehensive security assessment reports with multiple output formats
---

Generate comprehensive security assessment reports from agent findings with customizable formats and executive summaries. This command:

1. **Data Aggregation**: Collect and consolidate findings from multiple assessment sources
2. **Risk Analysis**: Calculate CVSS scores, business impact, and remediation priorities
3. **Report Customization**: Generate reports tailored to specific audiences and requirements
4. **Compliance Mapping**: Align findings with regulatory frameworks and standards
5. **Executive Summaries**: Create high-level summaries for management and stakeholders

**Usage**: `/generate-report assessment-data [--format executive|technical|bug-bounty|compliance] [--audience client|internal|bug-bounty] [--compliance owasp|nist|pci|iso27001]`

**Report Formats**:
- `executive`: High-level business risk summary for management
- `technical`: Detailed technical findings for security teams
- `bug-bounty`: Professional bug bounty submission format
- `compliance`: Regulatory compliance assessment report

**Audience Customization**:
- `client`: External client penetration testing report
- `internal`: Internal security team assessment
- `bug-bounty`: Bug bounty platform submission

**Compliance Frameworks**:
- `owasp`: OWASP Top 10 and ASVS alignment
- `nist`: NIST Cybersecurity Framework mapping
- `pci`: PCI DSS compliance assessment
- `iso27001`: ISO 27001 control alignment

**Report Sections**:
- **Executive Summary**: Business risk overview with key metrics
- **Methodology**: Assessment approach and tools used
- **Findings Summary**: Vulnerability statistics and severity breakdown
- **Detailed Findings**: Technical details with reproduction steps
- **Risk Assessment**: Business impact analysis and CVSS scoring
