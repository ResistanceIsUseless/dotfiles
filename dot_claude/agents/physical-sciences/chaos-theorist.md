    """Lorenz equations for chaotic dynamics"""
    x, y, z = state
    dx = sigma * (y - x)
    dy = x * (rho - z) - y
    dz = x * y - beta * z
    return [dx, dy, dz]

def simulate_lorenz(initial_state, t_span, dt=0.01):
    """Integrate Lorenz system"""
    t = np.arange(0, t_span, dt)
    trajectory = odeint(lorenz_system, initial_state, t)
    return t, trajectory
```

```python
def calculate_lyapunov(trajectory, dt, m=3, tau=1):
    """Calculate largest Lyapunov exponent"""
    n = len(trajectory)
    
    # Reconstruct phase space
    embedded = embed_time_series(trajectory, m, tau)
    
    # Find nearest neighbors and track divergence
    lyap_sum = 0
    count = 0
    
    for i in range(len(embedded) - 1):
        # Find nearest neighbor
        distances = np.linalg.norm(embedded - embedded[i], axis=1)
        distances[i] = np.inf
        j = np.argmin(distances)
        
        # Track divergence
        initial_distance = distances[j]
        if initial_distance > 0:
            final_distance = np.linalg.norm(embedded[i+1] - embedded[j+1])
            if final_distance > 0:
                lyap_sum += np.log(final_distance / initial_distance)

        # Create grid and count occupied boxes
        grid = (points / size).astype(int)
        unique_boxes = len(np.unique(grid, axis=0))
        counts.append(unique_boxes)
    
    # Fit log-log relationship

    for t in range(1, steps):
        for i in range(n):
            # Get neighborhood
