**Extension Architecture Patterns**:

**Background Script Architecture**:
```javascript
// Manifest V3 Service Worker
// background.js
chrome.runtime.onInstalled.addListener(() => {
  // Initialize extension state
  chrome.storage.local.set({ initialized: true });
});

chrome.action.onClicked.addListener((tab) => {
  // Handle extension icon clicks
  chrome.scripting.executeScript({
    target: { tabId: tab.id },
    function: injectContentScript
  });
});
```

**Content Script Patterns**:
```javascript
// content.js
(function() {
  'use strict';
  
  // Avoid conflicts with page scripts
  const extensionNamespace = 'myExtension_' + Math.random();
  
  // Message passing with background
  chrome.runtime.sendMessage({
    action: 'pageAnalysis',
    data: analyzeCurrentPage()
  });
  
  // Clean event listeners on extension unload
  window.addEventListener('beforeunload', cleanup);
})();
```

**Cross-Browser Messaging**:
```javascript
// Unified messaging system
class ExtensionMessenger {
  static sendMessage(message) {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
      const browser = this.getBrowser();
      browser.runtime.sendMessage(message, response => {
        if (browser.runtime.lastError) {
          reject(browser.runtime.lastError);
        } else {
          resolve(response);
        }
      });
    });
  }
  
  static getBrowser() {
    return typeof chrome !== 'undefined' ? chrome : browser;
  }
}
```

**Extension Security Patterns**:

**Content Security Policy**:
```json
{
  "content_security_policy": {
    "extension_pages": "script-src 'self'; object-src 'self'; frame-ancestors 'none';"
  }
}
```

**Secure Data Storage**:
```javascript
// Encrypted storage for sensitive data
class SecureStorage {
  static async setSecure(key, data) {
    const encrypted = await this.encrypt(JSON.stringify(data));
    return chrome.storage.local.set({ [key]: encrypted });
  }
  
  static async getSecure(key) {
    const result = await chrome.storage.local.get(key);
    if (result[key]) {
      const decrypted = await this.decrypt(result[key]);
      return JSON.parse(decrypted);
    }
    return null;
  }
}
```

**Store-Specific Requirements**:

- Minimize CSS injection and styling conflicts
- Use intersection observers for visibility detection

**Memory Management**:
- Remove event listeners on script unload
- Clear timeouts and intervals properly
- Implement object pooling for frequently created objects

**Testing and Quality Assurance**:

**Automated Testing Pipeline**:
```javascript
// Extension testing with Playwright
test('Extension popup functionality', async ({ page, extensionId }) => {
  // Navigate to extension popup
  await page.goto(`chrome-extension://${extensionId}/popup.html`);
  
  // Test popup interactions
  await page.click('[data-testid="settings-button"]');
  await expect(page.locator('.settings-panel')).toBeVisible();
  
  // Test extension functionality on test page
  await page.goto('https://example.com');
  await page.waitForFunction(() => window.myExtensionInjected);
});
```
