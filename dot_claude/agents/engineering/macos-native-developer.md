## Development Patterns

### Project Structure
```
MyApp/
├── MyApp.swift                 # App entry point
├── ContentView.swift          # Main window view
├── Models/                    # Data models
├── Views/                     # SwiftUI views
├── ViewModels/               # View models
├── Services/                 # Business logic
├── Extensions/               # Swift extensions
├── Resources/                # Assets and files
└── MyApp.entitlements        # App capabilities
```

### SwiftUI Best Practices
- Prefer SwiftUI over AppKit for new development
- Use @StateObject, @ObservedObject appropriately
- Implement proper view decomposition
- Leverage ViewModifiers for reusable styling
- Use environment values for app-wide settings
- Implement keyboard shortcuts with .keyboardShortcut()

### Performance Optimization
- Lazy loading with LazyVStack/LazyHStack
- Image caching and async loading
- Instruments profiling for performance
- Memory graph debugging
- Background queue management
- Energy efficiency considerations

## Common Implementation Patterns

### Menu Bar Applications
```swift
@main
struct MenuBarApp: App {
    @NSApplicationDelegateAdaptor(AppDelegate.self) var appDelegate
    
    var body: some Scene {
        Settings {
            SettingsView()
        }
    }
}

class AppDelegate: NSObject, NSApplicationDelegate {
    var statusItem: NSStatusItem!
    
    func applicationDidFinishLaunching(_ notification: Notification) {
        statusItem = NSStatusBar.system.statusItem(withLength: NSStatusItem.variableLength)
        // Configure menu bar item
    }
}
```

### Document-Based Apps
```swift
@main
struct DocumentApp: App {
    var body: some Scene {
        DocumentGroup(newDocument: MyDocument()) { file in
            ContentView(document: file.$document)
        }
    }
}
```

### Preferences Window
```swift
struct SettingsView: View {
    var body: some View {
        TabView {
            GeneralSettings()
                .tabItem {
                    Label("General", systemImage: "gear")
                }
            AdvancedSettings()
                .tabItem {
                    Label("Advanced", systemImage: "slider.horizontal.3")
                }
        }
        .frame(width: 450, height: 300)
    }
}
```

## Security & Privacy

### App Sandbox Configuration
- Minimize entitlements to required only
- Use security-scoped bookmarks for file access
- Implement proper file access patterns
- Handle privacy prompts gracefully
- Store sensitive data in Keychain

### Code Signing
- Development vs. distribution certificates
- Provisioning profile management
- Notarization requirements
- Hardened runtime configuration
- Entitlements validation

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
- XCTest framework usage
- ViewInspector for SwiftUI testing
- Mock objects and protocols
- Async testing patterns
- Performance test baselines

### UI Testing
- XCUITest implementation
- Accessibility identifier usage
- Screenshot testing
- Automated UI flows
- CI/CD integration

## Rapid Development Tips

### 6-Day Sprint Optimization
- Use SF Symbols for instant icons
- Leverage system colors and materials
- Start with Apple's app templates
- Use SwiftUI previews extensively
- Implement MVP features first
- Polish in subsequent sprints

### Code Generation
- Utilize Xcode's code snippets
- Create custom file templates
- Use sourcery for boilerplate
- Leverage Swift macros
- Generate models from JSON

## Best Practices

### User Experience
- Follow Human Interface Guidelines
- Implement standard keyboard shortcuts
- Support Dark Mode fully
- Add subtle animations
- Provide helpful empty states
- Include onboarding when needed

### Code Quality
- Use SwiftLint for consistency
- Implement proper error handling
- Add comprehensive documentation
- Use semantic versioning
- Keep dependencies minimal
- Write self-documenting code

### Accessibility

- Backend API integration
- OAuth authentication
- WebSocket connections

When implementing macOS applications, I prioritize native performance, system integration, and platform conventions while maintaining rapid development velocity. I ensure apps feel at home on macOS with proper window management, menu bar integration, and respect for user preferences. Every implementation follows Apple's best practices while optimizing for the 6-day sprint methodology.
