## Testing Methodology

### Phase 1: Reconnaissance and Enumeration
1. **Target Information Gathering**
   - Domain enumeration and subdomain discovery
   - Technology stack identification
   - Attack surface mapping
   - Social engineering research (OSINT)

2. **Network Discovery**
   ```bash
   # Network reconnaissance examples
   nmap -sV -sC target.com
   subfinder -d target.com | httpx -title -tech-detect
   nuclei -t exposures/ -u target.com
   ```

### Phase 2: Vulnerability Discovery
1. **Automated Scanning**
   - Web application vulnerability scanning
   - Network vulnerability assessment
   - Configuration security analysis

2. **Manual Testing**
   - Business logic vulnerability testing
   - Complex authentication bypass attempts
   - Custom payload development and testing

### Phase 3: Exploitation and Impact Assessment
1. **Proof-of-Concept Development**
   - Working exploits for identified vulnerabilities
   - Demonstration of real-world attack scenarios
   - Impact assessment and business risk evaluation

2. **Post-Exploitation Analysis**
   - Privilege escalation attempts
   - Lateral movement possibilities
   - Data access and exfiltration potential

### Phase 4: Documentation and Reporting
1. **Professional Reporting**
   - Executive summary with business risk assessment
   - Technical findings with detailed reproduction steps
   - Remediation guidance with priority levels
   - Compliance mapping (OWASP, NIST, etc.)

## Security Testing Tools Integration

### Core Tools
- **Burp Suite Professional**: Web application security testing
- **Nuclei**: Fast vulnerability scanner with custom templates
- **Nmap**: Network discovery and security auditing
- **SQLMap**: Automated SQL injection testing
- **Metasploit**: Exploitation framework for verified vulnerabilities

### Custom Tools
- **proxyhawk**: HTTP proxy traffic analysis
- **webscope**: Web application reconnaissance automation

### Code Analysis
- **Semgrep**: Static analysis for security vulnerabilities
- **Bandit**: Python security linting
- **Gosec**: Go security checker
- **CodeQL**: Semantic code analysis

## Ethical Guidelines and Boundaries

### Strict Ethical Standards
1. **Authorization Required**: Never test systems without explicit written authorization
2. **Scope Compliance**: Stay within defined testing scope and objectives
3. **Data Protection**: Never access, modify, or exfiltrate sensitive data
4. **Minimal Impact**: Use least-intrusive testing methods possible
5. **Responsible Disclosure**: Report vulnerabilities through appropriate channels

### Testing Limitations
- **No Destructive Testing**: Avoid DoS attacks or data corruption
- **Production Environment Care**: Use extreme caution in production systems
- **Legal Compliance**: Adhere to all applicable laws and regulations
- **Documentation**: Maintain detailed logs of all testing activities

## Report Generation Template

### Executive Summary
- High-level risk assessment
- Business impact analysis
- Remediation priority matrix
- Compliance implications

### Technical Findings
